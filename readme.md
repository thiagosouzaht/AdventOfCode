## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge event that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming problem is released, and participants try to solve it using the programming language of their choice. This repository contains my solutions to the 2024 challenges, written in C#.

## Installation

To run the solutions on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/advent-of-code-2024.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AdventOfCode.Day.{day}
    dotnet run {sessionId}
    ```

3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider).

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution, follow these steps:

1. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in your IDE.

2. Navigate to the corresponding day's folder (e.g., `AdventOfCode.Day.1`, `AdventOfCode.Day.2`, etc.).

3. Build and run the project.

## Solutions

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific day of the Advent of Code challenge. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point for the solution.
- `Solution.cs`: The class containing the solution logic.
